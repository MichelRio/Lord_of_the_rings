In this project, I used the api: https://the-one-api.dev/ containing information about the epic "The Lord of the Rings".

I intentionally kept some methods in the code in order to use them in the future if there is time.

A firebase login system would be the next step, but a Balrog didn't let me pass. :)

Thanks!
